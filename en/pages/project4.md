# P4: Final report and presentation

At this point, you now need to wrap up this project, and deliver it to whomever gave you the project to begin with (normally your boss, but in this case, your instructor and TAs). A normal "real life" process here would involve a professional presentation and project report.

Your presentation should present ideas at a very high level, and should cover the following topics:
- Who is this presentation/project report for?
- What is the design problem being addressed here?
- Who are you designing for, and what is the context of their activities?
- What are the main things you discovered in your user research?
- What were the major design decisions that you made? (i.e. what did you decide were must haves vs. should haves; how did you arrive at the final design ideas?)
- How do you justify your design decisions?
- What did you discover from your heuristic evaluation?
- What did you discover from your user testing?
- How would you address these in the next iteration of the design?

You should organize your final report with the following headings (roughly):
- Executive Summary
- Introduction
- Design Problem
- User Research and Findings
- Design and Justification
- Heuristic Evaluation and Findings
- User Testing and Findings
- Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design
- Conclusions

##Major activities
- Test with 3 to 5 users
- Execute 2 to 3 tasks
- **Modify hi-fi prototype (p3) to include improvements from the testing**

## Deliverable
- **Final presentation (or showcase presentation).** This is a 15 minute presentation where you are to construct a powerpoint slide deck. Make sure that you use the pictures and images/scans of your project. Do not go over time. At 15 minutes, we will abruptly end your presentation. You will also answer questions from us and labmates for 5 minutes. Note: this is expected to a PowerPoint presentation.
- **Final report.** This write-up should essentially be a summary of the major components from the previous steps of your project, but the point is to present it professionally and succinctly. You will submit this on your GitHub portfolio and let us know via Slack.

Note: The report and presentation should focus on the last 3 items (user testing and findings, recommendations for next iteration of design and conclusions for the project).
