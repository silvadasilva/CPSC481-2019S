## Updates
|        Date        |          Topic           |   Description and Tasks  |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Jun 4th (Tutorial) | Hi-fi Prototype          |- TA gives a presentation about Hi-Fi prototyping. <br/> - TA gives students an exercise - to pick one task from their project and convert it from low-Fi prototype to Hi-Fi. <br/> - Students are required to complete their final Hi-fi prototype on their own outside of class time.   |
| Jun 6th (Tutorial) | Hi-Fi Prototype delivery |- Tiago and Lorans decided to drop the heuristic evaluation at this stage. <br/> - Students are required to ONLY deliver a Hi-Fi prototype on the 6th of Jun. <br/> - Students will have 10 min to present their prototype and then TA will give them feedback (just like the low-fi presentation day). <br/> - Students will have until 11:59 PM â€“ 6th of June to submit their final Hi-fi prototype.    |
| Jun 11th (Tutorial)| Heuristic Evaluation     | - TA will have a short presentation to explain what is expected during the heuristic evaluation session. <br/> - Students will have the entire TA session to conduct heuristic evaluation on other groups projects. <br/> - Students will complete the evaluation and can complete the evaluation report after the class time. <br/> - Students are required to attach their evaluation report with their final project deliverables.   |
| Jun 13th (Tutorial)| User Testing             | - TA will have a short presentation to explain what is expected during the user testing session. <br/> - Students will have the entire session to work on the tasks and run a pilot study of their user testing. <br/> Students are required to complete the user testing outside of the class time. Students need to test with AT LEAST 3 users.      |
| Jun 17th (Lecture) | Final Presentation day   | - All students MUST prepare a final presentation for their project. <br/> - Students cannot exceed the specified presentation time. <br/> - Students will have until 11:59 PM on June 17 to submit their final report.   |


This course provides an introduction to the process of designing, creating and evaluating tools or artifacts for direct human use.

## Description

Computing technology is rapidly becoming ubiquitous and embedded in our everyday lives, owing in large part to increasing miniaturization and exponential growth in processing power. This changes everything. What your grandfather learned about UI design no longer applies -- computers are no longer just things we sit in front of; instead, computation appears in all sorts of devices -- our mobile phones, tablets, even in our homes! Today, we think of computation as enabling experiences. The focus of this class is learning how to design user experiences within the context of computation.

This means that we will need to investigate and understand how people currently use technology, and think about how they might be able to use new technologies. From here, we try to design technologies to suit the kinds of user experiences they want to have. This process of designing user experiences is a creative one, leveraging both your technical skills, and your decision making skills. You will learn to apply several state-of-the-art methods, aimed to help hone your programming, critical thinking and communication skills. Because this process always involves making trade-offs, the methods you learn will help you to be more creative, as well as to make informed decisions about which trade-offs to make.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:
- Differentiate between and argue for the utility of different design methods
- Practice several methods for designing effective interfaces
- Effectively argue for how to ground designs in reality
- Evaluate interface quality
- Apply your training: (a) in industry, or (b) in research

To do this, you will get hands-on experience applying multiple methods for interface design and evaluation.

## Evaluation

| Component     | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Assignments   | 7%   |
| Participation | 8%    |
| Project       | 40%   |
| Mid-term      | 15%   |
| Final         | 30%   |

Participation is assessed via two sub-components: (1) tutorial participation, and (2) in-class participation.

Midterm and Final are closed-book exams where your knowledge retention, reasoning and written communication skills will be assessed.

- You will be able to do a peer review. At the end of the term you will report how each team member participated on the development of the project. You will evaluate each member based on their behavior during the term and which mark you would give to each one from your team. The evaluation will be anonymous to your teammates.

## Workload

This is an intense course with a lot of team work.

This intensity is higher in a Spring or Summer offering, because each week in these offerings is equivalent to two weeks in a regular Fall or Winter term.

The recommended amount of time to spend on your studies is 2-3 hours per credit per (normal) week, right from week 1. This is a 3-unit course, which means 6-9 hours devoted to studying each week (this includes reading, reviewing, preparation for exams, assignment time, project time, etc.).
