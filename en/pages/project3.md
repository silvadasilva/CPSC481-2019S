# P3: Hi-fi prototypes and heuristic evaluation

In P2, you developed a wide space of ideas, and focused on developing a number of sketches, polishing a limited set. In practice, you would use these polished sketches, along with your low-fi prototype to get feedback from potential users. Ideally, you would go through several iterations of this, where you develop ideas, gather feedback, and continue to develop more ideas.

At some point, your customers are going to want to see a more tangible prototype. These are ways that you can develop prototypes to not only understand what the resulting system may look like, but also what it feels like to interact with. Using these prototypes, you could easily evaluate your interface with users, understanding what aspects of the interaction works well, and what doesn't. These "quick and dirty" prototyping methods allow you to get that idea without expending the major effort that is required to develop a prototype using code. You were able to get a taste of this by building your low-fi prototype.

For this project component, you will actually develop a prototype of your system using a high-fidelity prototyping tool. You should develop a deep vertical prototype that addresses all the "must have" tasks you identified in P1, and refined in P2. Your prototype should follow the design ideas you identified and lo-fi prototype in P2, but only to the extent that it makes sense. If you discover that an alternate idea/design works better, feel free to implement this; however, you will need to be clear about this modification, and justify it for both P3 and P4.

In practice, your job now is to develop a hi-fi prototype, deliver it by Mar 17, conduct heuristic evaluation in one of your colleagues project and report on the main findings.

## Major activities
- Develop the hi-fi prototype
- Deliver it during the tutorial (another group will conduct a heuristic evaluation on your project)
- Conduct a heuristic evaluation on the project of another group.
- Report on the main findings


## Deliverable
- High fidelity prototype
- Evaluation report with the main findings
- You will submit this on your website portfolio and let us know via Slack
