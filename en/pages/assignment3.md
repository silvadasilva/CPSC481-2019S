# A3: Visual Design

In this assignment, your task is to redesign (according to the visual design concepts seen during Tim's lecture) the same computational system you evaluated in A1.

You can start by changing the layout and the images. Next, change the font and typography, then try changing the color palette.  As you do this, you should see the impact of your changes on the overall aesthetic. This will hopefully help you to understand the relationship between these design choices, and better inform your own design work.

**This is a group assignment.**

- Redesign the system
- Write a report presenting your choices and explaining them
