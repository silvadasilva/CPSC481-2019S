# Team Project

Note: The final presentations (P4) are going to be during the week of the 8-12 depending on what section you are in.

The project is a hands-on opportunity to try the methods and ideas that we cover and discuss in class -- in particular, to engage in a user-centered design process. The two main lessons to be learned here is that: (a) designers do not rely on their intuition, but instead rely on real user research, and that (b) design is really about a process. This is a process that you can apply as a software developer in the real world.

You will choose a project idea to work from, and use that project idea for every component. The project has four main components. The first component asks you to consider real users in the context of real activities, and understand their real needs. The second component is about the process of brainstorming and iteratively developing and building on ideas quickly and cheaply, asking you to identify the most important aspects of your system. The third component is about building the system in a low fidelity prototype. In the final component, you build the system in a fully functional hi fidelity prototype and evaluate the interface/system that you have built by carrying out user testing, provide a brief report, and presentation about the entire scope of your project.


## Teams
The project is to be completed in teams of five (at most), where all members are from the same tutorial section. The idea here is to work as a deep dive group to generate a wide breadth of alternate and varied design ideas -- just as you would in the real world.

Teams will create and operate under the particulars of their own team contract (P0). Consequences can be as severe as kicking a team member off the team.

## Portfolio
Your team will submit projects via a portfolio site. The idea is to use this as a portfolio site for your work, allowing you to see the evolution of your work, and for you to showcase your work to potential employers later.

| Component                                          | Value | Date |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------|------|
| [P0: Team contracts + project scope](#!pages/project0.md) - Establishing a set of rules that outline how the team will work, expectations, and consequences for poor performance. Also, a brief description of the scope of your project.                                         | 2%    | Jan 25  |
| [P1: User research](#!pages/project1.md) - Conduct two different IDEO methods to learn about your users in their environment. Submit a report describing your process and experiences.                                 | 7%    | Feb 17  |
| [P2: Ideation and Lo-fi prototypes](#!pages/project2.md) - Brainstorm and sketch a variety of possible interfaces for your system, identifying important aspects of a user's flow. Present your process, ideas and low-fi prototype.                  | 8%   | Mar 03  |
